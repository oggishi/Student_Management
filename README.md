## Professional overview

Student_Management is a robust, extensible Java application built to simplify administrative work at schools, bootcamps, and training centers. It centralizes student records, tracks course enrollment and progress, automates grade calculations, and provides exportable reports for accreditation and auditing. The project is designed with maintainability, testability, and production readiness in mind.

Intended audiences:
- Academic administrators and registrars
- Instructors and teaching assistants
- DevOps and engineering teams integrating student systems into institutional pipelines
- Developers building education-related extensions or analytics

## Key features

- Student CRUD (create, read, update, delete) with validation
- Course and section management
- Enrollment workflow (enroll/withdraw)
- Grade recording and GPA calculations
- Role-based access (Admin, Instructor, Student) — extendable
- Exportable reports (CSV/JSON/PDF)
- Tests and CI-friendly build configuration
- Clear separation of concerns to ease maintenance and extension

## Architecture (high level)

- Domain: entities and business rules (Student, Course, Enrollment, Grade)
- Service layer: application business logic and validations
- Persistence: repository/DAO layer (JDBC/JPA placeholders)
- API / UI: REST controllers or CLI wrappers depending on included modules
- Tests: unit and integration test suites

This repository follows a modular structure to keep concerns isolated and to make future refactors (microservices, separate reporting service) straightforward.

## Technology stack

- Language: Java (100% of repository)
- Recommended: Java 11+ (or specify your target JVM)
- Build tools: Maven or Gradle (see repository for actual build files)
- Persistence: JDBC / JPA (configurable to H2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- Optional: Spring Boot (if included), Lombok (optional), Flyway/Liquibase for migrations
- Testing: JUnit, Mockito (or repo-specific choices)

> Note: Replace the recommended frameworks/tools above with those actually used in this repo (Spring Boot, plain Java SE, etc.). The README contains generic steps for common Java builds that will work for most setups.

## System requirements

- JDK 11+ (or repo-specified JDK)
- Maven 3.6+ or Gradle 6+ (if the repo uses either)
- A relational DB (H2 for dev, PostgreSQL/MySQL for production) — optional for in-memory testing

## Quick start — build & run

The exact commands depend on the repository's build setup. Try the most common flows below.

With Maven:
```bash
# compile and run tests
mvn clean verify

# build runnable JAR (if the project builds a jar)
mvn clean package

# run (adjust jar path if different)
java -jar target/student-management-<version>.jar
```

With Gradle:
```bash
# build and run tests
./gradlew build

# run (if an application plugin is configured)
./gradlew bootRun
```

Plain Java (if the project is a simple module):
```bash
# compile
javac -d out $(find src -name "*.java")

# run
java -cp out com.yourorg.Main
```

Configuration:
- Edit src/main/resources/application.properties (or config file used by the project) to set DB URL, credentials, and server port.
- Example placeholders:
  - datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/studentdb
  - datasource.username=youruser
  - datasource.password=yourpassword
  - server.port=8080

## Tests

Run unit and integration tests with your build tool:
- Maven: mvn test
- Gradle: ./gradlew test

Aim for small, fast unit tests and isolated integration tests that can run in CI.

## Docker (optional)

A sample Dockerfile (if the project produces a jar):
```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/student-management-<version>.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app/app.jar"]
```

Build & run:
```bash
docker build -t oggishi/student-management:latest .
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env oggishi/student-management:latest
```

## Configuration & environment

- Use environment variables or an externalized configuration (12-factor app) for DB credentials, secrets, and runtime configuration.
- Provide a sample .env.example or application-example.properties in the repo to make onboarding easier.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions. To contribute:
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
2. Write tests for new behavior and run the test suite
3. Open a PR with a clear title and description of what you changed and why
4. Follow the code style and add changelog entries if relevant

Add a CONTRIBUTING.md to specify coding standards, testing expectations, and PR checklist.

## Roadmap & ideas

- Improve RBAC and authentication integrations (OAuth2 / SAML)
- Add analytics and dashboards for performance monitoring
- Add import/export templates (SIS integrations)
- Provide a lightweight frontend or admin UI

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

- Build fails on JDK version: ensure you have the repository's required JDK installed (check .java-version or pom.xml)
- DB connection errors: check datasource config and ensure the DB is running and accessible
- Tests fail: run `mvn -X test` or `./gradlew test --info` to get detailed logs

## Core functions (overview)

1. Student Management
   - Description: Create, read, update, delete student records with validation and search.
   - Key fields: studentId, firstName, lastName, dob, email, phone, address, status, enrollmentDate, metadata

## Example user stories & acceptance criteria (ready to convert into issues)

- As an Admin, I can create a student record so I can maintain accurate student information.
  - Acceptance: POST /api/students returns 201 and student appears in GET /api/students

- As a Student, I can enroll in a section if seats are available.
  - Acceptance: Enrollment created with status=enrolled; section capacity decreases; when capacity reached, further enrollments are waitlisted

- As an Instructor, I can post grades for my section.
  - Acceptance: Grades linked to enrollments and GPA updates accordingly; unauthorized instructors cannot edit other instructors' sections

- As an Admin, I can export all enrollments for a term to CSV.
  - Acceptance: Export file available and matches filters used

---

## Implementation notes & recommendations

- Framework: If possible, use Spring Boot + Spring Data JPA for rapid API + persistence development; otherwise plain Java + a lightweight framework (Javalin, Spark) is acceptable.
- DB: Start with H2 for local dev and tests; support PostgreSQL in production profiles.
- Testing: Use JUnit + Mockito; prefer integration tests against an in-memory DB or Testcontainers for Postgres in CI.
- Transactions: Wrap enrollment and waitlist promotion logic in DB transactions to avoid race conditions.
- Concurrency: Use optimistic locking or DB constraints for capacity enforcement.
- Config: Use externalized config (application.properties / environment variables). Provide application-example.properties and .env.example.

---

## Suggested next actions (concrete)
- I can convert each prioritized task into GitHub issues with descriptions, acceptance criteria, and labels (P0/P1/P2). Tell me if you want me to create those issues for you.
- If you prefer, I can also add skeleton Java packages (entities, repositories, services, controllers) and a sample build file (pom.xml or build.gradle) to get the project compiling.

---

## Questions to finalize scope
- Which build tool and framework should I assume? (Maven or Gradle; Spring Boot or plain Java)
- Target Java version (e.g., 11, 17)
- Do you want background jobs via a scheduler (Quartz / Spring Scheduler) or external worker?
- Preferred DB (H2 for dev / Postgres / MySQL)
- Any specific export format or storage target (local disk / S3 / Google Cloud Storage)?
